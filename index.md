# Welcome to the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) Ecology Page

Welcome! The Stan ecology page is meant to serve as a centralized location for all types of work in ecology that use the software [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for Bayesian inference. As a community, we can share our work with each other and learn from each other as well! Anyone can contribute helpful resources, papers, posters or anything else ecology-related that makes use of Stan, regardless of the level, through the [Stan ecology GitHub page](https://github.com/StanEcology/stanecology.github.io). 

To ask Stan-related questions, please go to [https://discourse.mc-stan.org/](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/). More specifically, we can all use the `Ecology` tag to ensure that posts are seen by anyone interested in general ecological problems as well. See [https://discourse.mc-stan.org/tag/ecology](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/tag/ecology). 

To join the Stan Slack channel, go to [Stan Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mc-stan/shared_invite/enQtMzAyNzg1ODQ5MDczLTc1M2Q1YzM4ZjY5MzRjMGFlNDcyYzRhOGYxNTRlZjRlZjI2YzYxZjYyMDRlNDYzOTY5YzU5MTgzM2JlZjAxNTk).
